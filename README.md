🛕 Smart Pilgrimage Crowd Management System

🌍 Problem

Every year, millions of devotees visit famous temples like Somnath, Dwarka, Ambaji, and Pavagadh in Gujarat. During festivals and holidays, these places become overcrowded, leading to:

Long queues and waiting times

Safety risks like stampedes and health emergencies

Traffic jams and parking problems

Lack of real-time updates for pilgrims

Poor support for elderly and differently-abled visitors


Right now, crowd management is mostly manual (police, barricades, basic queues), which is not enough when lakhs of people arrive at the same time.

Key features include:

📊 AI-based Crowd Prediction – Forecasts rush using past data, festivals, and weather.

🎟️ Smart Queue & Ticketing – Virtual queues, digital passes, and live wait-time updates.

📹 IoT + CCTV Monitoring – Sensors, AI cameras, and drones for real-time crowd density checks.

🚨 Emergency Response System – Panic detection, instant alerts, and medical mapping.

🚗 Traffic & Parking Management – Smart parking guides, shuttle coordination, and traffic flow control.

📱 Pilgrim App (Multilingual) – Provides timings, darshan slots, routes, facilities, and emergency info.
